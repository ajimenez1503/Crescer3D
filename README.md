# Crescer3D
Inspired by the online game "agar.io" we develop a "smash and run" game where you are a sphere in a world. Goal is to eat other spheres ("food") to grow in size and to avoid contact with enemies, since bigger enemies could eat you as well. Setup is on a plane in a 3D world.


## Build Targets
The project makefile consists of a build target for OS X, Linux and Cent OS 6.7.

### How to build Crescer3D:

####1.) Run "make mac" for OS X, "make linux" for Linux or "make centos" for Cent OS 6.7
#### Depending on the build target everything should work automatically now.

####2.) Run the game with "./game" from Console
