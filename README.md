# Crescer3D
Inspired by the online game "agar.io" we want to do a "smash and run" game where you are a sphere in a world. Goal is to eat other spheres ("food") to grow in size and to avoid contact with enemies, since bigger enemies could eat you as well. Setup is on a plane in a 3D world, with the possibility to jump and collect bonuses like speed, split up, having spikes, shooting, e.g.


## Build Targets
The project makefile consists of a build target for OS X and Linux. The mainfile needs to define in lines 1+2 the fitting system variable and then you can use "make mac" or "make linux" for building it for the desired system.
