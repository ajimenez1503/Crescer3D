# Crescer3D
Inspired by the online game "agar.io" we want to do a "smash and run" game where you are a sphere in a world. Goal is to eat other spheres ("food") to grow in size and to avoid contact with enemies, since bigger enemies could eat you as well. Setup is on a plane in a 3D world, with the possibility to jump and collect bonuses like speed, split up, having spikes, shooting, e.g.


## Build Targets
The project makefile consists of a build target for OS X and Linux.

### How to build Crescer3D:

####1.) Run "make mac" for OS X or "make linux" for Linux
#### Depending on the build target everything should work automatically now.

####2.) Run the game with "./Crescer3D" from Console
